I play lead guitar & do backup harmonies for indie-rockers [King & Queen of the Losers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHxOuc4abgqdwGqND3a74A). Their debut record [Crutch](https://kingandqueenofthelosers.bandcamp.com/album/crutch) was released in 2017, and their followup American Squalor arrives in December of 2019. We'll be touring with this record in 2020.
