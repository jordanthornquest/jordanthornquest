I played lead guitar & do backup harmonies for indie-rockers [King & Queen of the Losers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHxOuc4abgqdwGqND3a74A). Their debut record [Crutch](https://kingandqueenofthelosers.bandcamp.com/album/crutch) was released in 2017, and their followup [American Squalor](https://kingandqueenofthelosers.bandcamp.com/album/american-squalor) released in December of 2019. The group officially disbanded in 2020.
