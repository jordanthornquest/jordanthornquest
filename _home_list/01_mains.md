I play lead guitar in a power-pop band called [Mains & Monitors](https://mainsandmonitors.com). We just released an album called [Kalani](https://mainsandmonitors.bandcamp.com/album/kalani), and we're super friggin' proud of it. I led the recording work on this project at Neighborhood Sounds, and it was post-produced by [Jack Shirley](http://theatomicgarden.com/jack) at the Atomic Garden (Jeff Rosenstock, Deafhaven, Remo Drive).
